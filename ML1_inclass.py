Mild disclaimer
"""
# Do not worry about understanding the machine learning in this example!
# We go over kNN models at length later in the course; you do not need to
# understand exactly what the model is doing quite yet.
# For now, ask yourself:

# 1. What is the purpose of data splitting?
# It allows us to separate our training data from our testing data, so we can evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
# 2. What can we learn from data testing/validation?
# We can understand how our model performs on new data and identify any issues regarding fitting.
# 3. How do we know if a model is working?
# A model should be working if it performs well on both training and testing data.
# 4. How could we find the model error?
# We could find the model error by calculating different metrics, like accuracy and presicion.

# If you want, try changing the size of the test data
# or the number of n_neighbors and see what changes!
